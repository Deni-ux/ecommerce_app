This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## What is this project?
This is my first ecommerce website learning project. It is a fullstack application with payments functionality integrating Stripe.

## Technologies 

- **Advanced React** Best Practices: Folder and file structure, hooks and refs
- **Advanced State Management** of the entire application using **React Context API**
- **Next.js Best Practices: File-based routing, Data fetching that allows server-side rendering and static generation (show getServerSideProps, getStaticPaths, getStaticProps), Next.js as a backend endpoint.
- **Stripe** to manage payments, products, shipping rates, and the entire checkout process
- **Sanity**, you or your clients will be able to change the storeâ€™s homepage and more importantly, the details of all the products in the store, instantly and on the go! Sanity allows us to focus on developing the application without having to worry about the content, file storage, and databases.
